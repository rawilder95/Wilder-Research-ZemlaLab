        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        For each round in this task, you will be given a category and asked to list as many
        items from that category as you can. For instance, if the category is
        instruments, you should list as many instruments as you can recall.
        <ul>
            <li> You will have 90 seconds to list as many items from the category as possible.
            <li> Please rely only on memory alone.
            <li>
                Do not enter the same item twice in a round, or list two items with the same suffix.<br>
                For example if you list "guitar", do not list "guitars" in the same round.
        </ul>
        You will be asked to do this 24 times in total.

        You will now have 30 seconds to count backwards from one number by another number.  <br><br>
        Don't worry about making a mistake and having the remainder of your answers be off. Just continue counting backwards from that number onwards.  <br> <br>

        If it is a category you've already done, it's OK to list items you've
        listed before, but you may also list new items. Please try to list as
        many items as possible, but only list an item once per round.<br><br>
