        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        For each round in this task, you will be given a category and asked to list as many
        items from that category as you can. For instance, if the category is
        instruments, you should list as many instruments as you can recall.
        <ul>
            <li> You will have three minutes to list as many items from the category as possible.
            <li> Please rely only on memory, and do not search the Internet for answers.
            <li>
                Do not enter the same item twice in a round, or list two items with the same suffix.<br>
                For example if you list "guitar", do not list "guitars" in the same round.
        </ul>
        You will be asked to do this nine times in total.
